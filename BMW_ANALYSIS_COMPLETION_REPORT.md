## 🏢 Dealer Analysis Results

### ✅ Completed: Ben's First 3 Dealerships (Rows 44-46)

| Row | Dealer | Status | Fees Found | Analysis Method |
|-----|--------|---------|------------|----------------|
| 44 | Bomnin Volvo Cars Dadeland | ✅ Complete | Yes - Below fold | Standard MCP |
| 45 | Braman BMW Jupiter | ✅ Complete | Yes - VDPs | **Lightweight MCP** |
| 46 | Braman BMW Miami | ✅ Complete | Yes - VDPs | **Lightweight MCP** |

### 🔧 Technical Solution Implemented

**Problem Confirmed:**
- BMW Jupiter: Token overflow at 30,160 tokens (limit: 25,000)
- BMW Miami: Token overflow at 29,314 tokens (limit: 25,000)
- Even simple JavaScript evaluation fails due to massive DOM size

**Solution Architecture:**
1. **Smart Fallback System**: Main MCP → Lightweight MCP on token failures
2. **Lightweight MCP Server**: Returns <1KB responses instead of full page snapshots
3. **Claude Code Integration**: MCP configuration at `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`
4. **Adaptive Strategies**: Site-specific BMW analysis patterns
